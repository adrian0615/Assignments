Hey TJ,


On the Decimal conversions, I multiplied each corresponding decimal by x^0, x^1, x^2â€¦.. depending on which conversion I was doing (binary, octal, and hexadecimal).

On the Hexadecimal conversions, I did a counting method to get the resulting conversion.

I now realize that both methods were wrong.  Stay tuned for updated calculations
